The goal of MarineSPEED is to provide a benchmark data set for presence-only 
species distribution modeling (SDM) in order to facilitate reproducible and 
comparable SDM research. It contains species occurrences (coordinates) from a 
wide diversity of marine species and associated environmental data from 
Bio-ORACLE and MARSPEC. Some additional information about MarineSPEED can be 
found in the R Shiny viewer at <http://marinespeed.org>.

## Ãˆxploring the data

Three functions help with exploring

```{r}
library(marinespeed)

# list all species
species <- list_species()
```

The first 5 species and there aphia_id (WoRMS species id) are:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(species[1:5,], row.names = FALSE)
```

The traits data consists of species identifiers, taxonomic information from the 
World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), a visual assessment score for the 
amount of sampling bias and the most common traits from the Encyclopedia of Life.

```{r}
# all species traits
traits <- species_traits()
colnames(traits)
```

## Looping over all species data

To loop over the occurrence data of all species you have to call the 
*lapply_species* function. For instance if you wanted to count the total number 
of records in MarineSPEED you'd need the following code. As you can see the 
function passed to *lapply_species* expects to parameters, one for the 
species name and one for the actual occurrences.

```{r, cache = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
get_occ_count <- function(speciesname, occ) {
  nrow(occ)
}
record_counts <- lapply_species(get_occ_count)
sum(unlist(record_counts))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
868151
```


## Cross-validation

To enable the usage of the same cross-validation k-fold datasets I splitted
species occurrence data upfront in 5 folds (or 4 and 9 for grid) in 3 different ways:

- disc: disc partitioning of occurrences with pairwise distance sampled and 
buffer filtered random background points.
- grid: partitioning of the data based on splitting the records along the x- and 
y-axis in groups of records with equal numbers of records. Data was split in 4 
(2 by 2) and 9 (3 by 3) folds.
- random: random partitioning of occurrences and random background points.
- targetgroup: same way of partitioning as the random folds but instead of
random background points, a random subset of all occurrences points was used
creating a targetgroup background points set which has the same sampling bias
as the entire dataset.

Below code plots the training (blue) and test (red) occurrences for the first 
two disc folds of the first two species.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

## plot first 2 disc folds for the first 2 species (blue=trainig, red=test)
plot_occurrences <- function(speciesname, data, fold) {
  fname <- paste0(sub(" ", "_", speciesname), fold, ".jpeg")
  jpeg(filename = fname)
  title <- paste0(speciesname, " (fold = ", fold, ")")  
  plot(data$occurrence_train[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch=20, col="blue",
       main = title)
  points(data$occurrence_test[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch=20, col="red")
 
  dev.off()
}

x <- lapply_kfold_species(plot_occurrences, species=species[1:2,],
                     fold_type = "disc", k = 1:2)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
## plot first 2 disc folds for the first 2 species (blue=trainig, red=test)
plot_occurrences <- function(speciesname, data, fold) {
  title <- paste0(speciesname, " (fold = ", fold, ")")
  plot(data$occurrence_train[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch=20, col="blue",
       main = title)
  points(data$occurrence_test[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch=20, col="red")
}

lapply_kfold_species(plot_occurrences, species=species[1:2,],
                     fold_type = "disc", k = 1:2)
```

## Lower level functions

- *get_occurrences*: get all occurrences for some or all species
- *get_fold_data*: get training and test folds for occurrences and background
for a species
- *kfold_occurrence_background*: to create k folds for other species records
